# Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

## Problem
Given a string of integers separated by spaces, find the longest increasing subsequence.
If multiple sequences have the same maximum length, return the earliest one.

## Solution
- Implemented in C# .NET
- Uses Dynamic Programming (O(n²))
- Deterministic output with earliest sequence selection
- Covered with unit tests using xUnit

## How to Run
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test
