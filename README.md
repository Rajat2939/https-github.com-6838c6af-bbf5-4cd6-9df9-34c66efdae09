# Longest Increasing Subsequence (C# .NET)

## Objective
Translate a problem into a working solution using C# .NET, demonstrate clean and readable code,
unit testing, and provide clear instructions to verify the solution.

---

## Problem Statement
Given a string of integers separated by single whitespace, determine the
**longest increasing subsequence (LIS)**.
If multiple subsequences have the same maximum length,
the **earliest occurring subsequence** is returned.

---

## Solution Overview
- Implemented using **Dynamic Programming (O(n²))**
- Deterministic tie-breaking for earliest sequence
- Written in **C# .NET**
- Unit tested using **xUnit**

## Example

Input: 6 1 5 9 2
Output: 1 5 9
